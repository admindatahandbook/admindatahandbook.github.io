Physically Protecting Sensitive Data,Jim Shen and Lars Vilhuber,security,handbook_ch2_Physical-protection,Lars Vilhuber,https://www.povertyactionlab.org/person/vilhuber,,,,,,,"Keeping sensitive data safe relies heavily on the physical environments in which data are stored, processed, transmitted, and accessed, and from which researchers can access computers that store and process the data. However, it is also the setting that is most dependent on rapidly evolving technology. The chapter provides snapshot of the technologies available and in use as of 2020, and characterizes the technologies along a multi-dimensional scale, allowing for some comparability across methods.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPGSxO2PexQ&ab_channel=J-PAL,2/8/2021
Model Data Use Agreements-- A Practical Guide,Amy O'Hara,dua,handbook_ch3_DUA,Amy O'Hara,https://gufaculty360.georgetown.edu/s/contact/0033600001nHXCZAA4/amy-ohara,,,,,,,"Data use agreements (DUA)—also referred to as data sharing agreements or data use licenses—are documents that describe what data are being shared, for what purpose, for how long, and any access restrictions or security protocols that must be followed by the recipient of the data. Creating, negotiating, and finalizing a DUA is one of the most common challenges facing new data partnerships, but there are few practical references available to guide data providers and researchers. The chapter gives a valuable set of model agreements for new engagements with administrative data and expert insight on the legal agreements that underpin data access.

Collaborating with the Institutional Review Board (IRB) ,Kathleen Murphy,irb,handbook_ch4_IRB,Kathleen Murphy,"Kathleen Murphy, PhD, MSW, MLIS, is a Certified IRB Professional, retired from Northwestern University IRB in 2019 after serving as a Board member, Vice Chair, and Manager of the Social and Behavioral IRB",,,,,,,"The IRB is an administrative body that reviews human research (defined by 45 CFR 46.102 (e)(1)) to ensure the ethical protection of participants from the reasonably foreseeable risks of harm caused by research. For example, an inadvertent disclosure of sensitive or identifiable information is a common risk in social and behavioral research because the disclosure can result in social, psychological, or legal harm. The goal of this chapter is to provide researchers, data providers, data stewards, and other stakeholders with the tools they need to understand the IRB process. The chapter focuses on what the IRB does and does not do and what researchers, data providers, and related stakeholders can expect from IRB review. IRB review is a key step in launching projects, and learning about the IRB perspective will help researchers and policymakers understand how to successfully navigate this process.

Balancing Privacy and Data Usability: An Overview of Disclosure Avoidance Methods,Ian M. Schmutte and Lars Vilhuber,discavoid,handbook_ch5_SDL,Ian M. Schmutte,http://ianschmutte.org/,,,,,,,"The Five Safes framework (safe projects, safe people, safe settings, safe data, and safe outputs) is one way of thinking about security of different aspects of a project, and is used throughout the Handbook and in research with administrative data. Within the Five Safes framework, data providers need to create safe data that can be provided to trusted safe people for use within safe settings, as part of safe projects. Finally, any findings that are shared publicly must be safe outputs. The processes used to create safe data and safe outputs (manipulations that render data less sensitive and therefore more appropriate for public release) are generally referred to as statistical disclosure limitation (SDL). This chapter describes techniques traditionally used within the field of SDL, pointing at methods as well as metrics to assess the resultant statistical quality and sensitivity of the data, and offers technical guidance applicable to any data provider or researcher looking for practical tools to apply to their own data to reduce the risk to privacy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GK-N-SN3BrY&list=PL5Dr5MK6NSsqd9eJf_VwPVpp7EXMXM5Hg&index=4,11/2/2020
Designing Access with Differential Privacy,"Alexandra Wood, Micah Altman, Kobbi Nissim, Salil Vadhan ",diffpriv,handbook_ch6_DP,Alexandra Wood,https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/awood,,,,,,,"Differential privacy technology has passed a preliminary transition from being the subject of academic work to initial implementations by large organizations and high-tech companies that have the expertise to develop and implement customized differentially private methods. With a growing collection of software packages for generating differentially private releases from summary statistics to machine learning models, differential privacy is now transitioning to being usable more widely and by smaller organizations. The chapter explains how administrative data containing personal information can be collected, analyzed, and published in a way that ensures the individuals in the data will be afforded the strong protections of differential privacy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu-sTV8J2M&list=PL5Dr5MK6NSsqd9eJf_VwPVpp7EXMXM5Hg&index=11&t=4s,2/1/2021

The RDC-IAB has three core functions: creating standardized research data for the scientific community, providing access to these data, and conducting research with and about IAB data. Various kinds of standardized labor market data are provided by the RDC-IAB. Administrative research data are based on the notification procedure of the German Social Security System and process-generated data are based on the BA. Additionally, surveys conducted by the IAB or partner institutes become part of the data portfolio. Furthermore, linked data between surveys and administrative data are produced. All data products are specifically created for the purpose of allowing external researchers access to the data. The chapter describes how data is made available to researchers at multiple universities around the world, and how the data held by the RDC-IAB is securely accessed through legal, institutional, and practical processes.

The Private Capital Research Institute: Making Private Data Accessible in an Opaque Industry,"Josh Lerner, Leslie Jeng, and Therese Juneau",pcri,handbook_ch10_PCRI,Josh Lerner,https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=9961,,,,,,,"An increasing share of economic activity today is taking place in settings that elude traditional federal data collection mechanisms or fail to capture the richest of the activity at work. Against this backdrop, economists are increasingly turning to private data. The chapter describes the experience of the Private Capital Research Institute (PCRI), specifically the process of creating a database to facilitate access to private equity information for academics to address the myriad major concerns regarding private data. While this effort is certainly a work in progress, hopefully the experience can guide researchers who want to address similar issues in other fields.",,3/1/2021
Aurora Health Care: Using Electronic Medical Records for a Randomized Evaluation of Clinical Decision Support,Laura Feeney and Amy Finkelstein,ahc,handbook_ch11_Aurora,Laura Feeney ,https://www.povertyactionlab.org/person/feeney,,,,,,,"This case study describes a randomized evaluation using administrative data, focusing on the process for sharing and using individual-level data from electronic medical records (EMR) for project with Aurora Health Care (a large, private, not-for-profit, integrated health care provider in Wisconsin and Illinois, comprising fifteen hospitals and more than 150 clinics in thirty communities). In this case, the delivery of the intervention and the measurement of outcomes were conducted through the EMR system, making access to administrative data a critical feature of the research project. This chapter describes the process by which the research team sought approval to conduct the study and access data, worked to understand data not originally designed for research, and addressed the challenges of working with de-identified data. Leveraging the rich administrative data captured through electronic medical records for research on mutually interesting questions led to a successful partnership with a large, private, healthcare organization.",https://www.povertyactionlab.org/person/feeney,11/16/2020
