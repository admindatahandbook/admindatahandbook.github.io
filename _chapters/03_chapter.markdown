Data use agreements (DUA)—also referred to as data sharing agreements or data use licenses—are documents that describe what data are being shared, for what purpose, for how long, and any access restrictions or security protocols that must be followed by the recipient of the data. Creating, negotiating, and finalizing a DUA is one of the most common challenges facing new data partnerships, but there are few practical references available to guide data providers and researchers. The chapter gives a valuable set of model agreements for new engagements with administrative data and expert insight on the legal agreements that underpin data access.
