The research-practice partnership between Stanford University and the San Francisco Unified School District is a long-term, mutualistic, and strategic relationship between researchers and practitioners in education, resulting in research that is both related to practical challenges and generalizable to the broader field. The Partnership exemplifies the university-based data center model, which benefits from the academic and technical resources at a large research university. SFUSD administrative data housed at Stanford University captures data on over 55,000 students, over 3,500 PreKâ€“12 teachers, and a total of almost 10,000 staff from the academic year 2000/2001 to the present. In 2018, the Stanford data warehouse that hosts school district data received requests for data by nine projects.
