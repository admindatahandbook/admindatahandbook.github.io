A new data policy at City of Cape Town government in 2016 led to a productive cooperation between the City and academic researchers to create systematic data access. This partnership between local government and university researchers prioritized strategic use of city administrative data to inform decision making for key policy challenges, including a 2018 drought crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. This chapter describes the legal and institutional background for the partnership, and how data has been used to respond to pressing policy challenges using interactive dashboards and randomized evaluations.
