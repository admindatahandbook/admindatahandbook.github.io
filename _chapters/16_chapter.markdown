Researchers at J-PAL Southeast Asia and the World Bank have a longstanding partnership with the Government of Indonesia to evaluate and scale social policy. This partnership began when researchers worked with the Government of Indonesia to utilize administrative data in implementing the Raskin ID card program, and has since grown to include multiple evaluations and a unique collaboration on the administrative data collection process through nationwide government surveys. This chapter tells the story of this partnership and describes the policy implications of collaborations between researchers and policy makers.
