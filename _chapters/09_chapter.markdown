This chapter describes the establishment and development of the New Brunswick Institute for Research, Data and Training (NB-IRDT) in Fredericton, NB, Canada. Launched in 2015 with the delivery of the first data set, NB-IRDT now holds and provides research access to more than 45 linkable person-level data sets from across the spectrum of service provision in NB. This includes access to data on health, social assistance, education and training, aged care, and workers compensation. The chapter highlights notable and unique aspects of the NB-IRDT partnership, including the legal context for receiving data from across NB public bodies, data access that is not restricted to academic users alone but also includes users from government, the non-profit sector, and the private sector, and active engagement with the NB government in collaborative research on government priority areas.
