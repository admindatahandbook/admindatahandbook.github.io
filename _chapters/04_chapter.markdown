The IRB is an administrative body that reviews human research (defined by 45 CFR 46.102 (e)(1)) to ensure the ethical protection of participants from the reasonably foreseeable risks of harm caused by research. For example, an inadvertent disclosure of sensitive or identifiable information is a common risk in social and behavioral research because the disclosure can result in social, psychological, or legal harm. The goal of this chapter is to provide researchers, data providers, data stewards, and other stakeholders with the tools they need to understand the IRB process. The chapter focuses on what the IRB does and does not do and what researchers, data providers, and related stakeholders can expect from IRB review. IRB review is a key step in launching projects, and learning about the IRB perspective will help researchers and policymakers understand how to successfully navigate this process.
