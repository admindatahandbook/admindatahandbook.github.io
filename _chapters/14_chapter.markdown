As a global research program, DIME provides tailored impact evaluation services to governments. With about 200 long-term collaborations with government agencies across sixty countries, DIME works with governments to develop the data infrastructure and know-how to improve the evidence-base for public policy over time. In partnership with about thirty multilateral and bilateral organizations, DIME also invests in transforming the way development finance is used. The chapter describes how DIME generates demand from government agencies and supplies them with research services that augment their data, program management, and policy functions. DIME's work ranges from developing a pilot administrative data system, to digitizing paper-based administrative data, to leveraging existing cross-sector administrative data to develop a country data set, and to developing sector-specific data sets across multiple countries.
