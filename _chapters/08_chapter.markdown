A research center at Ohio State University, the Ohio Longitudinal Data Archive (OLDA) is a long-running and successful administrative data partnership that first emerged in 2007. The OLDA has a primary research focus on the outcomes of education and training, but also engages with researchers on human services, housing, and health care as need arises. This collaboration between the Ohio state government and Ohio State University makes longitudinal data from multiple state agencies available for research, and offers an example of a robust institutional partnership for researchers and data providers looking to launch their own data center.
