This chapter describes an important stage in an ongoing J-PAL partnership with the Puerto Rico Department of Education (PRDE). Researchers supported the implementation of an online diagnostic assessment test, which took the place of standardized testing of students of grades 3 to 8, and 11 in the subjects of math, English as a second language, and Spanish during the Covid-19 pandemic when the shift to remote learning disrupted standardized testing. In addition to supporting an ongoing randomized evaluation, this assessment offers an opportunity to measure learning loss for future decision-making and research studies. It describes this period of support, the broader relationship, and lessons learned from working with state governments and administrative data. This case study reflects the state as of November 2021 in an evolving project and partnership between J-PAL, the researchers, and PRDE.
