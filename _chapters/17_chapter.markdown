In this case study, researchers at the Harvard Kennedy School (HKS) partnered with the Massachusetts Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) to evaluate the effect of the Massachusetts Residential Assistance for Families in Transition (RAFT) program on housing outcomes (housing status, eviction, and others) as well as a broader range of outcomes including employment, income, public assistance receipt, and potential downstream effects such as those on the education of children in families. This case study describes J-PAL North Americaâ€™s support in the development of a data-sharing partnership between multiple agencies in the state of Massachusetts to develop multiple data use agreements that enable data providers to successfully use administrative data for decision-making and evaluation.
