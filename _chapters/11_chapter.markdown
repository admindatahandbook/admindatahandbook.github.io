This case study describes a randomized evaluation using administrative data, focusing on the process for sharing and using individual-level data from electronic medical records (EMR) for project with Aurora Health Care (a large, private, not-for-profit, integrated health care provider in Wisconsin and Illinois, comprising fifteen hospitals and more than 150 clinics in thirty communities). In this case, the delivery of the intervention and the measurement of outcomes were conducted through the EMR system, making access to administrative data a critical feature of the research project. This chapter describes the process by which the research team sought approval to conduct the study and access data, worked to understand data not originally designed for research, and addressed the challenges of working with de-identified data. Leveraging the rich administrative data captured through electronic medical records for research on mutually interesting questions led to a successful partnership with a large, private, healthcare organization.
