Keeping sensitive data safe relies heavily on the physical environments in which data are stored, processed, transmitted, and accessed, and from which researchers can access computers that store and process the data. However, it is also the setting that is most dependent on rapidly evolving technology. The chapter provides snapshot of the technologies available and in use as of 2020, and characterizes the technologies along a multi-dimensional scale, allowing for some comparability across methods.
