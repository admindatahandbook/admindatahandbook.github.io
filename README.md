## Structure

- The HTML version of the book is served on a separate repository (see [book](https://github.com/admindatahandbook/book)). 
- The same repo creates the base epub documents, which are then subject to a bit of [post-processing](https://github.com/admindatahandbook/book/blob/master/_build_ebook.sh) and [hand-editing](https://github.com/admindatahandbook/book/tree/ebook-master/_book/EPUB).
  - The final files are zipped up again, and copied to the [ebook](ebook) directory (versioned)
- The base LaTeX was generated by the [book](https://github.com/admindatahandbook/book) repository, but then subjected to substantial hand-editing and reviewing on a private repository together with Overleaf
  - The printable PDF is downloaded from Overleaf, stored on the `releases` branch of the private `book-latex` repo, and copied here to the [print/](print/) directory (versioned)
  - The printable PDF is split into component chapters, and also copied to the [print/](print/) directory.
